# Terracotta Tours

In this portfolio project, you'll build a landing page for an adventure travel company.

This mockup has 8 main parts:  navigation, banner, main section, awards, featured content, browse section, booking section, and footer.

Successful completion of the project demonstrates appropriate use of layout tools:flexbox, grid and media queries, to build a responsive website.

## Getting Started Notes

- You're not given any HTML markup inside of the `<body></body>` tags, first start by outlining the main elements. Once you have done that, you can start implementing the styles. You'll be expected to edit `style.css` to implement the styles. 

- The `style.css` and `index.html` files are linked, which you can see in the `<head></head>` tag 

- Note about the layout: focus primarily on the layout grid. Use your knowledge of CSS grids and Flexbox to implement it.

- Implement and assign proper sizes for the assets. The page should be responsive, hence use media queries for different sizes.

- Assets and information about fonts and color schemes are given below. However, feel free to use your own.

## Design tokens

We want to make sure that our site has a consistent look and feel, that's why we use _design tokens_.


**Use of design tokens are encouraged, but not required.** 

### Font
